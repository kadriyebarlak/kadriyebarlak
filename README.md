<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Kadriye!</h1>

I'm a backend engineer with a passion for building high-impact, well-architected software.  

Lately, I've been exploring AI integrations and modern developer tools to stay at the edge of technology.  

Beyond code, I care deeply about creative thinking, positive energy, and excitement to the problem space and I bring that into every project I touch. 🌱  

🌍 Currently based in Istanbul  
🧠 Passionate about learning through building. My curiosity is my roadmap.  
🌸 Building a life and a career I love.
